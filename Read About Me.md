Hello, Welcome to my profile! 

If you're looking to work with a competent Data Analyst or Virtual Assistant for your project or establishment, then you've come to one of the best hands.

Let me tell you why...

My passion has always been about satisfying clients and helping businesses grow! This is why I love the world of data and projects. I also love helping to organize the busy schedules of my clients.

I enjoy data wrangling and mining data to discover actionable insights and recommendations that would help increase revenue in businesses and make customers as well as business owners happy. 

While I work, I look into company data to observe the dynamics of the business. I dig into the data and try to uncover hidden trends and insights that would help in better decision-making by the management team. Then I make valuable recommendations using compelling communication skills, informative visuals, and convincing story-telling!

Challenges come up often and as part of my abilities, I work out means to overcome them through problem-solving and critical thinking. Being a very tenacious person, I'm able to stay on a project and see it through, and this sets me apart from many other professionals.

I offer you my top skills in data cleaning, data profiling, data manipulation, data visualization, and data mining. I work with tools and technologies like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, databases, IBM Cognos, and Tableau. I'm experienced in Python for data analytics; and R programming. As a highly organized fellow, my data analytics skills also come in handy when carrying out Virtual Assistant duties. I hold the Google Data Analytics and IBM Data Analyst certifications amongst other credentials.

Finally, as a detail-focused and result-oriented professional, I don't like any break in communication and feedback. I'm open to understanding your particular project needs and tasks. If this sounds cool to you then get in touch with me, and I'll respond in no time!
